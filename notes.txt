Use dynamic service discovery instead of static addresses
  Currently, Envoy cannot find new instances automatically if you scale your services.
  Options:
    * EDS (xDS) from Consul
    * Consul template / Sidecar updating Envoy config

For now, you can keep static addresses in small setups, but note it’s not scalable.
Optional: restrict domains in virtual host instead of * to reduce attack surface.
